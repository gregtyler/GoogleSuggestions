# GoogleSuggestions

**Note for gregtyler/GoogleSuggestions:** I forked this to regenerate the data. I didn't write any of it originally (that was @flodebarre) so take no credit for the work!

## To do everything again:
type `./make.sh` in a terminal. 

*For more details on what is done,*  go read the report 
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/flodebarre/GoogleSuggestions/blob/master/report.html

## Contents:
- script.sh to fetch google suggestions
type ./script.sh typedata.csv (replacing typedata by actors/ted/aaas/tennis)
- report.Rmd to run the analysis and print the report.
- .csv datasets: lists of names
- make.sh to rerun the analysis.

## Acknowledgements
- Francois Bienvenu wrote a first version of the script fetching Google Suggestions in OCaml (available in the `oldstuff/` folder. He gave me the tip about the http://suggestqueries.google.com webpage.
- Nicolas Rode gave a few helpful tips for the analysis. 

All remaining errors are my fault.
